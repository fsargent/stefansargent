				<p>I&#8217;m making a documentary about Jamie. He used to be on Wall Street working for Merrill Lynch as a trader.</p>
<p><a href="https://prior.stefansargent.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/prodnotes-1-merrill_lynch_t2.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-403" title="ProdNotes-1-merrill_lynch_t" src="https://prior.stefansargent.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/prodnotes-1-merrill_lynch_t2.gif" alt="" width="432" height="334"/></a></p>
<p>One day, he wakes up in the morning and says, &#8220;Stuff this. I&#8217;m as mad as hell and I&#8217;m not going to take it anymore.&#8221; Sound familiar?</p>
<p>Chucks his job. Grabs his GF and moves to CA. Re-born as a Pinot Noir winemaker.</p>
<p>Finds the fruit. Buys it, crushes it with his and GF&#8217;s feet (honest). Blends it, bottles it, sticks the labels on and even delivers the boxes himself.<a href="https://prior.stefansargent.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/prodnotes-2-jamie.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-404" title="ProdNotes-2-jamie" src="https://prior.stefansargent.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/prodnotes-2-jamie.gif" alt="" width="432" height="251"/></a></p>
<p>He’s as happy as Larry Jordan, having escaped his Merrill Lynch hell. SO WHAT&#8217;S YOUR MERRILL LYNCH HELL?</p>
<p>Hmmm&#8230; Mine? No-brainer&#8230;</p>
<p>It’s<strong> </strong><strong>TALKING HEADS.<a href="https://prior.stefansargent.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/prodnotes-3-ss_shooting_tal.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-405" title="ProdNotes-3-SS_shooting_tal" src="https://prior.stefansargent.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/prodnotes-3-ss_shooting_tal.gif" alt="" width="432" height="324"/></a></strong></p>
<p>Yesterday, I shoot in a San Ramon park — 1, 2, 3, 4 THs — then we drive to UCSF to shoot another TH. That&#8217;s 5.</p>
<p>Drive home and Burton is waiting for us with — you guessed it — another TH. Aaarrgh! So 6 on Friday.</p>
<p>How about Thursday? 1,2, 3, 4, 5 THs in a house in SF, then drive to National Kidney Foundation for another. That&#8217;s 6. Drive to SFCAPC Headquarters and shoot two more. Total 6+2=8.</p>
<p>Thursday + Friday = 14 TALKING HEADS.</p>
<p>My own Merrill Lynch hell.</p>
<p>And even though I&#8217;m as mad as hell — I guess it&#8217;s what we do and we&#8217;d better accept it if we are going to meet that mortgage payment next Wednesday.</p>
<p>Talking Heads look good if you separate them from the background. Which brings me to DOF.</p>
<p>Snip from Wikipedia:<br/>
<em> In optics, particularly as relates to film and photography, the depth of field (DOF) is the distance in front of and beyond the subject that appears to be in focus.</em></p>
<p>For some images, such as landscapes, a large DOF may be appropriate, while for others, such as portraits, a small DOF may be more effective.</p>
<p>I use these three simple techniques:</p>
<p><strong>CHROMAKEY SHALLOW FOCUS<br/>
</strong> This is the easiest. Tricia and I can set up and light a greenscreen interview in less than 15 minutes. It&#8217;s a formula but it works and the results are brilliant. You can do this inside or out.</p>
<p>Bingo. Instant out-of-focus backgrounds.</p>
<p><strong>MOVING-MATTE SHALLOW FOCUS</strong><br/>
I use Paul Crisp’s free 16-point garbage matte. Get it here.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s winemaker Jamie. He&#8217;s actually doing a voiceover for me, I just let the camera run on auto. See how there is no separation between Jamie and his background. In fact the BG is brighter than Jamie.<a href="https://prior.stefansargent.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/prodnotes-6-jamie-clear.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-406" title="ProdNotes-6-jamie-clear" src="https://prior.stefansargent.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/prodnotes-6-jamie-clear.gif" alt="" width="432" height="243"/></a></p>
<p>Using the 16-point matte, I ding, ding, ding, ding around Jamie&#8217;s head on V2. Set the SMOOTH to 30 and the same on FEATHER EDGES.</p>
<p>V1 has the identical shot but with DEFOCUS blur from the FCP VIDEO FILTERS menu. I&#8217;m lazy, I use the default setting. I drop the luminance down to 85%. No need to go into the MOTION menu, just pull down the clip overlay line in the FCP timeline.<a href="https://prior.stefansargent.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/prodnotes-7-jamie-16-pt-mat.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-407" title="ProdNotes-7-jamie-16-pt-mat" src="https://prior.stefansargent.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/prodnotes-7-jamie-16-pt-mat.gif" alt="" width="432" height="244"/></a></p>
<p>Now the hard part. Your subject, in this case Jamie, may dare to move. Paul Crisp&#8217;s matte has a center point. Shift that up, down, left and right in your key frame timeline. The matte will follow Jamie&#8217;s movements. You may need to add 10 or more key frames for a short interview.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s mechanical work. Requires no thought. You can drink Jamie&#8217;s wine and listen to Zeppelin at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>OPEN-WIDE SHALLOW FOCUS</strong><br/>
Do as the dentist says and add ND filters. Shoot wide open at F2 or wider.</p>
<p>Here I am in a San Ramon park for the National Kidney Foundation. Noah was born with kidney disease. He has a kidney donated by his dad.<a href="https://prior.stefansargent.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/prodnotes-8-noah.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-408" title="ProdNotes-8-noah" src="https://prior.stefansargent.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/prodnotes-8-noah.gif" alt="" width="432" height="244"/></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;m 7 feet from Noah. He&#8217;s about 6 feet away from the wire fence, maybe 30 feet from the trees. I&#8217;m using a Sony V1 with 1/4 inch chips.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve put a ND 0.9 on the lens and thrown the Sony ND camera switch to add two more internal NDs. The result is F2 at 1080 60i. And look at that wire fence; anymore out of focus and it would disappear.</p>
<p>Who needs 35mm lens adaptors when simply opening up the iris reduces your DOF like this?</p>
<p><strong>HONEY, I WANT THE BACKGROUND SOFT<a href="https://prior.stefansargent.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/prodnotes-9-ps_technik.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-409" title="ProdNotes-9-P+S_technik" src="https://prior.stefansargent.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/prodnotes-9-ps_technik.gif" alt="" width="432" height="285"/></a><br/>
</strong></p>
<p>Spend around $6,500 on, say, a P+S Technik Mini35mm adapter and then, say, another $3,500 on a set of Nikon 35mm lenses. Now your humble Sony Z1 has the same depth of field as a regular 35mm movie camera. However besides spending 10 grand, you&#8217;ve also lost a stop and a half of light, which on 1/3&#8243; &amp; 1/4&#8243; chip cameras is serious. Not only that, for the price of the Sony camera plus the P + S thingy, you could have bought a 2/3&#8243; Panasonic camera!<a href="https://prior.stefansargent.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/prodnotes-10-last_stop.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-410" title="ProdNotes-10-last_stop" src="https://prior.stefansargent.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/prodnotes-10-last_stop.gif" alt="" width="432" height="259"/></a></p>
<p>Here is shallow DOF from a DV camera. It&#8217;s a frame grab from cinematographer Katie Milwright&#8217;s &#8220;Last Stop&#8221;. Beautifully shot on standard def. PAL DV with a P + S Technik adapter. For me, it&#8217;s a tad too soft but I guess that&#8217;s THE FILM LOOK Katie wanted.</p>
<p>See it here.</p>
<p><strong>SEEMED LIKE A GOOD IDEA AT THE TIME<br/>
</strong> Three years ago, I bought the cheaper, locally made 35mm lens adapter. You know the one that turns the picture upside down. It was their first model and it didn&#8217;t perform. I complained at NAB 2006. Was told it worked better with Panasonics than with the Sony Z1. Huh? Their web site didn&#8217;t say that.</p>
<p>Later, I complained again. &#8220;Don&#8217;t send it back. We have good news, Stefan. You&#8217;re the first to hear this, a real break through &#8211; there&#8217;s a new HD Diopter&#8221;.</p>
<p>Another $275 later, I&#8217;m experimenting again. My family is growing tired of being hauled in to sit still while I fiddle, fiddle, fiddle with the adapter.</p>
<p>Finally, I take the 35mm adaptor beasty with its new diopter out on an easy shoot in Phoenix, Arizona. You guess it&#8230; a series of THs one after the other.</p>
<p>Yikes! My #@!$%* 35mm lens adaptor is all out of whack again. Fiddle, fiddle, fiddle.</p>
<p>Try my usual lighting set up. Nope, it needs more light. Bring everything in closer, brighter. Her eyes are sharp but her hair is soft and of course the picture is UPSIDE DOWN. She leans forward. Aaarrgh. Her hair is sharp; her eyes are out of focus. Even worse, her nose is sharp; her ears are out of focus. Was it me or the adapter? I don&#8217;t know. My biggest, scariest, screw up in years.</p>
<p>And you know what? It didn&#8217;t look like film. It looked like an image projected onto ground glass &#8211; an upside down image to boot.</p>
<p>I love eBay; what a boon for early lens adapter adopters. Sold for more than I paid for it!</p>
<p>My friend, L.A. cameraman, <a href="http://www.dancoplan.com/" target="_blank">Dan Coplan</a> SOC, says the product in question has improved a lot since I bought it. Sorry Dan, I want it to work straight out of the box. Not, the &#8220;You need our new HD diopter&#8221; crap. Give me instant gratification.</p>
<p><strong>CITIZEN KANE</strong><br/>
Gregg Toland, he who shot Citizen Kane. (But you knew that, didn&#8217;t you?)<a href="https://prior.stefansargent.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/prodnotes-11-kane.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-411" title="ProdNotes-11-kane" src="https://prior.stefansargent.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/prodnotes-11-kane.gif" alt="" width="432" height="324"/></a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s another snip from Wikipedia:<br/>
<em> Toland&#8217;s techniques have proved to be a revolution for the art of cinematography. Before him, shallow depth of field was used to separate the various planes on the screen, creating an impression of space, as well as stressing what mattered in the frame by leaving the rest (the foreground or background) out of focus.</em></p>
<p>With Toland&#8217;s lighting schemes, shadow was a much more interesting tool, dramatically as well as pictorially, to separate foreground from background and thus to create space within a two-dimensional frame while everything was in focus. This technique was also, according to Toland, more comparable to what the eyes see in real life, since our vision does not blur what we look at, but what we do not look at.</p>
<p>So while we are trying to reduce DOF in search of the holy grail of THE FILM LOOK, Toland, the best cameraman in the world, was out there increasing DOF. He called it pan-focus or DEEP FOCUS.</p>
<div id="attachment_412" style="width: 442px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://prior.stefansargent.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/prodnotes-12-toland_two_pho.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-412" class="size-full wp-image-412" title="ProdNotes-12-toland_two_pho" src="https://prior.stefansargent.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/prodnotes-12-toland_two_pho.gif" alt="" width="432" height="192"/></a><p id="caption-attachment-412" class="wp-caption-text">Here&#039;s Toland himself center frame, an actor in the background and Toland&#039;s camera assistant in the foreground.  Left photo: foreground out of focus. Right photo: background out of focus.</p></div>
<p>Below, a single photo from a double-page spread in the May 26, 1941 issue of Life. Using pan-focus, both the FG and the BG are in sharp focus, but what happened to his arm? Is he double-jointed or what?<a href="https://prior.stefansargent.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/prodnotes-13-toland_pan_foc.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-413" title="ProdNotes-13-toland_pan_foc" src="https://prior.stefansargent.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/prodnotes-13-toland_pan_foc.gif" alt="" width="432" height="365"/></a></p>
<p>Think about it. He who knows what he&#8217;s doing, wants the foreground and background sharp. While, you and I with our baby video cameras, want the background soft and fuzzy.</p>
<p>And why? It&#8217;s all in search of the Holy Grail (drum roll, cymbal) THE FILM LOOK.</p>
<p><strong>HONEY, I SHOT THE KIDS</strong><br/>
Last week I photographed 20 school kids, one by one.</p>
<p>I had the 1080 60i HDMI output of my Sony V1 camera going straight into a Sony HD 1080 monitor. Uncompressed. No filters. No 24P. Just PURE VIDEO. It looked amazing. So clean. So transparent. Perfect as is.</p>
<p>Looking at those fresh, young faces on the HD screen, I thought, “If video had been invented first and film second, we&#8217;d be out there trying to create THE VIDEO LOOK.”</p>

				<p><strong>CENTRAL QUEENSLAND, AUSTRALIA. February 1968.</strong> I’m in a phone booth at sunset in a government farm and training facility for native aborigines. I get through to Dick Mason, my producer at Film Australia in Sydney, 1,000 miles south.</p>
<p>“Dick, this is a disaster. It’s a concentration camp for aborigines. I thought I was meant to be making a film called <em>The Aboriginal in Industry</em>.”</p>
<p>“Calm down.”</p>
<p>“And there’s a curfew. They can’t go out. The local townsfolk don’t want them. The aborigines’ windows have no glass. I interviewed the Little Hitler in charge and he said on camera, ‘You can’t trust an aboriginal with glass!’”</p>
<p>Dick catches a plane and drives for four hours. Discovers everything I have said is true. The shoot is aborted and we evacuate.</p>
<p><strong><em> Plan B</em></strong>: Go to Darwin, find other “aboriginals in industry.” So, this is how documentaries are made.</p>
<p><strong>DARWIN, NORTHERN TERRITORY. </strong>Three days of scouring Darwin and my PA has found an aborigine street cleaner and an aborigine garbage collector. I phone Dick in Sydney to tell him the bad news.</p>
<p>“Stay where you are. We’re working on it.”</p>
<p>For some time I’ve been wondering why, with so many directors on staff, they hired an outsider, lucky me. Now I know. This job is doomed.</p>
<p>The next day, Dick phones back. There’s an island between Australia and New Guinea where the local missionary did a deal that forces the BHP mining company to employ aborigines.</p>
<p><a href="https://prior.stefansargent.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/alc_home_map.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-110" title="ALC_home_map" src="https://prior.stefansargent.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/alc_home_map.jpg" alt="" width="380" height="370" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/alc_home_map.jpg 380w, /wp-content/uploads/2010/05/alc_home_map-300x292.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 380px) 100vw, 380px"/></a></p>
<p><strong><em> Plan C:</em></strong> Go there. And you thought we know what we’re doing.</p>
<p>We fly to Groote Eylandt, Gulf of Carpentaria. Land in the middle of the jungle. Wait three hours for the search party.</p>

<p><strong>GROOTE EYLANDT.</strong><br/>
I meet the missionary. Years earlier, a government surveyor had confided to him that the island was rich in manganese. He flew to Darwin and secured the mining rights for the aboriginals and laid down terms: They must be hired one-for-one with “white” Australians and paid the same wage.</p>
<div id="attachment_99" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://prior.stefansargent.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/keith-gow.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-99" class="size-full wp-image-99" title="keith gow" src="https://prior.stefansargent.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/keith-gow.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="469" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/keith-gow.jpg 600w, /wp-content/uploads/2010/05/keith-gow-300x235.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"/></a><p id="caption-attachment-99" class="wp-caption-text">Keith Gow on the Eclair camera - I&#039;m pretending to direct</p></div>
<p>The aborigines’ sanctuary is now a mine. Their reward is houses, schools, microwaves and motorcycles. This is going to be a tough. The film is being paid for by the Australian government. Make something critical; it will be junked. Go the other way — it’s a cop-out.</p>
<p>My solution is ART. Trick my government client into thinking this isn’t a run-of-the-mill documentary but something way more special: An artistic masterpiece.</p>
<p><strong>I DID IT MY WAY. </strong>Difficult balance. Too arty and you lose the audience and message. Too conventional and the suits will climb all over it.</p>
<p>So: Contrived compositions, often with the background or foreground way out of focus. Shooting through something always works&#8230; rain, smoke, fire, dust, heat haze, magnesium flares.</p>

<p>Combinations are fantastic — out-of-focus plus fire, smoke and heat haze all together! Wow! No talking heads, no name captions, just unidentified voiceovers. Heard but unseen distant explosions.</p>

				<p><a href="https://prior.stefansargent.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/pn_network.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-382" title="PN_network" src="https://prior.stefansargent.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/pn_network.gif" alt="" width="432" height="253"/></a><strong>&#8220;I&#8217;m as mad as hell and I&#8217;m not going to take this anymore!&#8221;<br/> </strong><br/> Why? Yesterday I read another Web article on creating THE FILM LOOK and today THIS &#8211; a review in a $10 glossy magazine. It&#8217;s about Canon&#8217;s terrific little HV20 camera, and it says:<a href="https://prior.stefansargent.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/pn_hv20_review_bg.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-383" title="PN_HV20_review_bg" src="https://prior.stefansargent.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/pn_hv20_review_bg.gif" alt="" width="432" height="44"/></a></p>
<p>How wrong can you be? The HV20 is a wonderful camera but 24P as favorite feature? No way! Read on, dear reader.</p>
<p>If you think that the HV20&#8217;s 24P mode makes video look like film, run, don&#8217;t walk, to an optician. Maybe to a psychiatrist as well!</p>
<p>Film negative is for printing, not for direct viewing. Similarly, 24P was devised as an intermediate process on the way to printing 35mm movie film &#8211; you weren&#8217;t meant to view it!<a href="https://prior.stefansargent.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/pn_img_3764_hv20_3q_back.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-384" title="PN_img_3764_hv20_3q_back" src="https://prior.stefansargent.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/pn_img_3764_hv20_3q_back.gif" alt="" width="432" height="257"/></a></p>
<p>Then the marketing folks thought it was a GOOD IDEA. And next thing it&#8217;s being promoted as part of THE FILM LOOK. Oh really?</p>
<p>Compare 24P footage from the Canon HV20 or the Sony V1U with, say, an action thriller, The Bourne Supremacy. There&#8217;s no comparision.</p>
<p>You can pile on all the color and gamma filters in the world and it&#8217;s still never going to look like Bourne &#8211; nor is cousin Fred going to look like Matt Damon.<a href="https://prior.stefansargent.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/pn_bournesupremacy.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-385" title="PN_BourneSupremacy" src="https://prior.stefansargent.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/pn_bournesupremacy.gif" alt="" width="432" height="281"/></a></p>
<p>Since that didn&#8217;t work, perhaps the problem is the HV20&#8217;s small chip size creating a huge depth of focus. Maybe you need a MOVIEtube, a P+S Technik 35, or a Redrock Micro M2 35mm adaptor tube. These help on close ups by throwing the background out of focus.</p>
<p>But going back to our Bourne movie &#8211; its wide shots are in sharp focus front to back. So that&#8217;s not the secret.</p>
<p><strong>AN EASY REALITY CHECK</strong><br/> Set up a High Def. HDMI monitor so that you see the live output of your HV20 camera. Now pan across the view from your window in 24P (actually: 23.98 progressive frames per second) &#8211; it&#8217;s going to be jerky.</p>
<p>Swap to 60i (actually 59.94 interlaced fields per second). Pan again. Surprise. It&#8217;s nice and smooth. Did the 24P jerks look like film? No way.</p>
<p>Now transfer both shots to FCP for editing. Use the 24P setting to match your 24 shot and, of course, 60i for the interlaced shot. Watch the playback on an HD screen. Which looked better &#8211; 24P or 60i?</p>
<p>Did FCP smooth out the jerkies? Nope. Wasn&#8217;t it meant to? I thought so.</p>
<p>Did the 24P shot look anything like film? Of course it didn&#8217;t. It looked like jerky video.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s face it, this FILM LOOK is a tough nut to crack. I know. I&#8217;ve been there too.</p>
<p><strong>MY SHAME &#8211; A SAD STROLL DOWN MEMORY LANE</strong><br/> Way back in the mid-&#8217;90s I bought the DigiEffects&#8217; CineLook plug-in for my Avid &#8211; I think I paid over a grand. I forget. I am in denial.<a href="https://prior.stefansargent.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/pn_cinelook.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-386" title="PN_cinelook" src="https://prior.stefansargent.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/pn_cinelook.gif" alt="" width="432" height="291"/></a></p>
<p>With CineLook, I could choose the film stock look that I wanted for my video. Hmmm, shall I have a 35mm stock Kodak&#8217;s 5245 or Fuji&#8217;s 8570 or perhaps a 16mm stock, maybe an Agfa?</p>
<p>The CineLook plug in took so long to render, that I bought a BlueICE accelerator board. It cost $3,500+. I am in denial on this purchase as well.</p>
<p>The &#8220;ICE&#8221; in BlueICE came from Integrated Computing Engines Inc a short lived Waltham, Mass. high tech. start up business.</p>
<p>&#8220;BlueICE&#8221; &#8211; what a misnomer. It ran so hot that my Mac&#8217;s innards almost dissolved in the heat. The heat sinks popped off the chips. I had little fans shoved into the motherboard, left, right and center and a big domestic fan on the floor.</p>
<p>Both the BlueICE accelerator board (bought and exorcised by Media 100) and DigiEffects Cinelook (bought and scrapped by Red Giant Software) are now locked safety away in my Broadcast Museum of Failure.</p>
<p>They are my own miserable versions of the search for THE FILM LOOK.</p>
<p>I too was a victim. I have suffered.</p>
<p><strong>I AM NOT ALONE</strong><br/> No more Mr. Nice Guy.</p>
<p><strong>NEED ANOTHER HOLE IN YOUR HEAD?</strong><br/> Peter Inova says, &#8220;The real-world need for 24p HD video is smaller than the need for another hole in your head.&#8221;<a href="http://www.digitalsecrets.net/secrets/HV20.html" target="_blank"> More.</a></p>
<p><strong>SHOOT AT 30</strong><br/> Lenny Lipton, filmmaker and now CTO of READ D says don&#8217;t shot 24P shoot 60i. &#8220;Given what&#8217;s available at this moment, were I to shoot a 3D movie, my preference would be to shoot at 30.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>MAYBE NOT THE BEST FORMAT</strong><br/> Even wise, old sage Larry Jordon says: &#8220;I&#8217;m completely ambivalent about the benefits of shooting 24 fps material. Just because Hollywood has been shooting film at 24 fps for years doesn&#8217;t mean this is the best format for your video &#8230; I&#8217;d suggest you consider spending your money on a 1/4 warm black ProMist camera lens filter and improving your lighting, both of which will do far more to improve your look than shooting 24 fps.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ambivalent&#8221; &#8211; is his cautious way of saying &#8220;steer clear.&#8221; <a href="http://www.larryjordan.biz/lj_workflow_canon_HV20.html" target="_blank">More.</a></p>
<p><strong>JUST ADD 16 EXTRA STEPS TO THE EDIT&#8230;</strong><br/> On the same Larry Jordan web page, Allan Tépper of the South Florida_Final Cut Pro Users Group writes: &#8220;Because of the incomplete way that 24p (23.976p) is recorded with the Sony HVR-V1U or the Canon HV20, approximately 16 extra steps are necessary before editing in order to get your 24p footage on a 23.976p timeline in FCP.&#8221;</p>
<p>Allan, who knows a thing or two, then goes on to list the extra 16 steps. These include: transferring to FCP, then exiting to Cinema Tools and using Reverse Telecine &#8211; back to FCP &#8211; and&#8230; oh, dear, spare me.</p>
<p>Graham Nattress has an excellent article on Ken Stone&#8217;s site listing the plusses and minuses of 24P. All clever stuff but pretty unhelpful if you&#8217;ve already ponied down your money on a HV20 and expect to get THE FILM LOOK, <a href="http://www.kenstone.net/fcp_homepage/24p_in_FCP_nattress.html" target="_blank">More.</a></p>
<p><strong>WHY I CRACKED</strong><br/> Now do you understand why I&#8217;m &#8220;as mad as hell&#8221;?</p>
<p>I pay $9.95 for new a glossy magazine. The front cover says BEST DV CAMERA. Then once they have my money, inside, I read the main reason for buying the Canon HV20 is 24P.</p>
<p>Strange. There&#8217;s no mention of the 16 different editing steps to make it work.</p>
<p>Money back, please.</p>
<p>Fat chance.</p>
<p>Jordan has the right idea. Try using some simple camera techniques and you&#8217;ll get far better results. Larry suggests a black ProMist filter. But once you&#8217;ve added that you can&#8217;t take it off. Far better to mist it up in post if that&#8217;s what you really want to do.</p>
<p><strong>ME AND MY HV20: THIS IS A 24P FREE ZONE</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#444444;font-weight:normal;"><a href="https://prior.stefansargent.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/pn_canonhv20_front.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-388" title="PN_CanonHV20_front" src="https://prior.stefansargent.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/pn_canonhv20_front.gif" alt="" width="432" height="356"/></a><em><strong>My Own HV20 Tips or Do It My Way</strong></em>.</span></strong></p>
<p>1) Shoot 1080 60i. That&#8217;s a given.</p>
<p>2) Use the CINE MODE. Despite the word &#8220;cine&#8221;, this is not the dreaded 24P.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s Cine Mode do? To start, it keeps camera sensitivity at 0 dB gain. It also changes the gamma curve by adding black stretch and slightly rolling off the white highlights.</p>
<p>Some web gurus say it locks the shutter speed. They are wrong. In my tests, I could shoot 24P at 60th/sec, once at 90th/sec, when it should be 48. The camera data proves it.</p>
<p>3) In the &#8220;Image Effect&#8221; menu &#8211; use the NEUTRAL filter, this drops the color saturation and seems to remove some artificial sharpness. Pity that the Canon designers are so coy about what the controls really do.</p>
<p>The plan is to give your edit a &#8220;flat&#8221; picture, that is one with mid range tones and no image enhancement. This gives you plenty of room to play in post. Tweak it up by adding color correction and a touch of sharpness but do it in post not on location.</p>
<p>4) Shoot at with a wide aperture, say F2. I can do this on my Sony not my Canon.</p>
<p>On my Sony V1, I shoot at F1.7 all the time.</p>
<p>Outside, I switch in the two internal Sony ND filters and then pop on an ND 0.6 in front of the lens.<a href="https://prior.stefansargent.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/pn_linda_f1-7.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-389" title="PN_linda_f1.7" src="https://prior.stefansargent.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/pn_linda_f1-7.gif" alt="" width="432" height="244"/></a><a href="https://prior.stefansargent.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/pn_f1-7screengrab.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-390" title="PN_F1.7screengrab" src="https://prior.stefansargent.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/pn_f1-7screengrab.gif" alt="" width="432" height="83"/></a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a video I took last year with my Sony V1U in bright, Californian sun with both sets of NDs on. It&#8217;s exposed at F1.7 &#8211; the data code says so. See how the contrast is lowered and the background trees and hills are out of focus without the need for an expensive 35mm adaptor tube, that will turn your image upside down.</p>
<p>Is it video or film? Video, of course, but who cares? The picture is all that matters.</p>
<p>Sadly, getting wide open with the HV20 is a different story. In practice, it&#8217;s nigh on impossible without the shutter whizzing up to 1,000th/sec.</p>
<p>Barry Green has his own convoluted method, which you&#8217;ll find <a href="http://dvxuser.com/jason/hv20/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>I guess it works for him but the web article gave me a throbbing headache. His tip about using the PHOTO button to discover your settings is good.</p>
<p>Make sure you have a miniSD card in the slot. Squeeze the PHOTO button and there&#8217;s your exposure. On a sunny day it will be something like F5.6 or F8 at 125th/sec. And you thought you were shooting 60i.</p>
<p>I have a Sony HVR-M25 playback deck. It reads the Canon camera data code and confirms that the PHOTO push down reading is accurate. 125 is a favorite HV20 shutter speed. I have the proof.</p>
<p>Even if you stack of ND filters all over the lens, nothing much changes. My personal best was F4 at 60 fps but that was with a pola, a ND 0.6 and a ND 0.9 filter. Ouch.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve thrown in the towel. I shoot with CINE MODE &amp; NEUTRAL and that&#8217;s it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a great camera for under $700. Don&#8217;t try to make it a $5,000 camera. And never, ever shoot 24P.</p>
<p>Now, repeat after me:</p>
<p><em><strong>I&#8217;m as mad as hell and I&#8217;m not going to shoot 24P anymore!&#8221;</strong></em></p>

				<p>I’ve landed the job, shot it, edited it. Now it’s time for the big client screening. Watch them watching. When the lights come up, will it be?</p>

<p><strong>PREMATURE REJECTION. LONDON, U.K. 1972.</strong> I’d made some conference films for Black &amp; Decker. They recommend me to Ron Hickman as they have licensed from him an invention called the Workmate. A demo film is needed, and Ron is coming to London to meet and see some of my work.</p>
<p>We’re in a screening room in Soho. I’ve put together a reel of three recent productions: The Redifon AWACS Flight Simulator, a film I made for Margaret Thatcher on education in England and my own favorite, The Birdseye Pea Story.</p>
<p>The lights dim. For the next 20 minutes, I sit back, proudly watching my three babies. The lights come up. I’m pumped, ready for praise.</p>
<p>But Hickman is hopping mad. “Are you stupid or something? I want a demonstration film showing a unique workbench and you give me school children, high-tech simulators and, worst of all, a film about harvesting peas. Have you ever made a construction film? Houses going up, do-it-yourself gadgets, carpentry demonstrations&#8230; ?!”</p>
<p>With that, Hickman leaves.</p>

<p><strong>CREWS FOR CRUISE<span style="color:#444444;">. </span>MALAGA, SPAIN, 1994.</strong> It’s the start of a five-day Mediterranean cruise. Our client, John Kenning, has written a series of books on how to get glam jobs — i.e. how to become a model, an airline steward or work on a cruise ship.<br/>
Tricia and I are in port aboard the Fred Olsen cruise ship Black Prince. It looks like fun, but, knowing <a href="http://dvproductiondiary.wordpress.com/2010/05/29/sargents-law/" target="_blank">SARGENT’S LAW</a>, we’re careful that we don’t enjoy ourselves too much.</p>
<div id="attachment_115" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://prior.stefansargent.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/black-prince.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-115" class="size-full wp-image-115" title="black prince" src="https://prior.stefansargent.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/black-prince.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="300" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/black-prince.jpg 703w, /wp-content/uploads/2010/05/black-prince-300x141.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"/></a><p id="caption-attachment-115" class="wp-caption-text">The Black Prince - Fred Olsen Lines</p></div>
<p>John has a lively personality. I make him the linkman. Put him on camera. Shoot an opener, a closing and some bridges: “Start cruising, it’s a job and a holiday all in one!”<br/>
John flies back to London. We sail off to the Greek Isles.</p>
<p>For the next five days, I don’t stop shooting. I’m up at daybreak, shoot all day. Every time we arrive at a Mediterranean isle, I’m down the gangplank first. It’s hot, the Betacam is heavy and I’m walking backwards interviewing the ship’s tour guide.</p>
<p>I shoot long takes so I don’t miss the unexpected, such as the crew member who accidentally falls in the pool while dodging a drink-carrying waiter.</p>
<p>Back in London. John sees the edit. The lights come up. Now the payoff.</p>
<p>“You’ve got a lot of lucky shots.”</p>
<p>“The guy falling into the pool?”</p>
<p>“No, it’s all lucky shots.”</p>
<p>I hear this all the time. Only last week: the lights come up and the client says my shots are “lucky.” Is it just me, or do real cameramen hear this too?</p>
<p>Francis: “Nice work, Vittorio — you got some lucky shots.”</p>
<p><strong>TEARS FOR CHEERS<span style="color:#444444;">. </span>SAN RAFAEL, CALIFORNIA. 1999.</strong> I’m making a pro bono for Peter Meyers, who teaches kids how to act at his Vector Theater Conservatory.</p>
<p>I use a cinéma vérité style of shooting; wiring up Peter and his teachers with radio mikes. Sit in for a few days with my PD150. I’m invisible; a neat trick.</p>
<div id="attachment_92" style="width: 648px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://prior.stefansargent.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/vector.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-92" class="size-full wp-image-92" title="vector" src="https://prior.stefansargent.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/vector.jpg" alt="" width="638" height="344" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/vector.jpg 638w, /wp-content/uploads/2010/05/vector-300x162.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 638px) 100vw, 638px"/></a><p id="caption-attachment-92" class="wp-caption-text">the end of one of Peter&#039;s stage performances</p></div>
<p>I run the edit to Peter. He has no idea what I’ve shot (I was invisible). He’s watching intently, smiling&#8230; now his expression changes. A tear rolls down his cheek. He’s crying. The lights come up — he’s a mess. I’ve made hundreds of films but no one has ever cried before. What did I do wrong?</p>
<p>“It’s so beautiful. You’ve captured all my dreams, hopes and aspirations.”</p>
<p>“Come on, Peter. It’s good, but not that good.”</p>
<p>Now I’ve used the G word.</p>

				<p>We all know Moore’s Law and Murphy’s Law, but how many of you know Sargent’s Law?<br/> Hmmmm… I thought so. Time to put that to rights.</p>
<p>Sargent’s Law simply states, <em>“The quality of a production is inversely proportional to the fun the filmmakers had while making it.”</em></p>
<p>Put another way: If everything goes wrong, the equipment breaks down, nobody is co-operative, the talent is a pain, the client is a terror; then the final production has a good chance of being amazingly wonderful.</p>
<p> </p>
<div id="attachment_83" style="width: 442px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://prior.stefansargent.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/production-diary.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-83" class="size-full wp-image-83" title="Production-Diary" src="https://prior.stefansargent.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/production-diary.gif" alt="" width="432" height="142"/></a><p id="caption-attachment-83" class="wp-caption-text">Fun and games in Cannes. Hard times in Queensland.</p></div>
<p> </p>
<p>The flip side? Take my French Riviera shoot. The location: a dream come true. The talent: my darling, Tricia. We ate like millionaires. Went to the Cannes Film Festival in a Rolls Royce. The Carlton Hotel gave us their private beach. Free use of Radar the Wonder Dog. Every day was sun and fun.</p>
<p>Sadly, the end product was crap. Don’t believe me? Here’s a job that was a constant nightmare, every day a different drama. Read on…</p>
<p><strong>SYDNEY 1967. CUT TO MY OFFICE &#8211; CUE RINGING TELEPHONE</strong><br/> KIP (Head of Documentaries at ABC Australia): Got any ideas for a one-hour documentary? Can be about anything. Come up with 10 ideas.</p>
<p>SS: Ten?! How about three?</p>
<p>KIP: Bureaucracy. Give me 10 and there’s a good chance that one will do the trick with the powers that be.</p>
<p><strong> A WEEK LATER:</strong> I’m stuck. Ideas one to four — a pushover. Five to eight — tough. Eight and nine — almost impossible. Number 10? Think of something silly. Something they won’t want.</p>
<p>My assistant Rosemary says, “Why not film my family in Longreach?” “Longreach?” “It’s in the middle of Queensland in the outback.”</p>
<p>Shock, horror — Kip and the Powers That Be bypass my really good ideas and chose the throwaway, number 10! I know nothing about country life and we haven’t asked Rosemary’s family if they’ll be in it!</p>
<p>Kip gives me a choice: Twenty rolls of 16mm color reversal stock or 40 rolls of black-and-white. I go for color, even though there’s no color TV in Australia. Problem is that with only 10 minutes per roll, I’ll have just 20&#215;10 = 200 minutes to shoot a 60-minute film; about a 3:1 shooting ratio.</p>
<p>These days, imagine making a one-hour program with three and a half DV tapes! To make it harder, I decide to have no narration, no interviews and no mood music. Just live, unrehearsed dialogue.</p>
<p><strong>A MONTH LATER. </strong>We fly to Longreach. Rosemary’s mother won’t to cooperate. We have to stay in town. It was meant to be a film about their 75,000-acre working sheep station in the magical outback and here I am in room 16, Lyceum Hotel, Eagle Street.</p>
<p>Can it get worse? Easy.</p>
<p>Suddenly, my only lens, an Angenieux zoom, goes out of focus. Now I have a 16mm Éclair NPR camera with no lens. Aarrrggghhh!</p>
<p>Rosemary finds a friend with a 1940 windup Bell &amp; Howell Filmo and a cheap 25mm C-mount lens. I screw the lens on to the Éclair and keep shooting. Want a wide shot? Get way, way back. Need a closeup? Move in closer.</p>
<p>I shoot the visiting Governor-General and his icy lady at the Debutante’s Ball. The dancers knock over one light. Then a deb trips over another. There goes my lighting.</p>
<p>They’re playing “Dancing in the Dark.”</p>
<p><strong>Good news.</strong> Rosemary’s brother, Stirling, will let us film his sheep and cattle ranch. We move out of the Lyceum. Stirling flies his boy to school in his Cessna and lands on the road. He spends the day herding sheep from a motorcycle. We go to the parent’s house where the evening meal is formal, complete with an aboriginal server in French maid costume.</p>
<p><strong>Bad news. </strong>I shoot scenes with local cowgirl, Tottie. The scene with her boyfriend is a disaster: “Hello Tottie.” “Hello Bruce.” “I’ve got tickets to the ball.” “Oh, goodie.” Tottie’s dialogue with her horse is better. I blow 300 precious feet.<br/> I am running out of stock. Good news. Tottie’s horse wins at the races. Bad news. My film runs out.<br/> Worse. I leave an exposed roll of film in an Avis car. I phone Avis. “If you find it please don’t open the can!”</p>
<p><strong>SAVED BY SARGENT’S LAW. </strong>No-fun shooting equals a good result.</p>
<p>The result: <em><strong>Edge of the Outback.</strong></em> Kip likes it. The ABC shows it.</p>
<p>Rave reviews. Aren’t I lucky that it went so badly?</p>

				<p><strong>London, U.K. Winter, 1972, 4:30 a.m</strong>. The worst thing about filmmaking is getting up before dawn and driving through the slush to a distant, even colder, location.</p>
<p>My best client, Herb Kanzell, has landed a job for the Rank Organisation. In its day, Rank owned Pinewood Studios, Odeon cinemas, a movie production company, Rank Xerox and Wharfedale, a little company making loudspeakers just outside of Leeds. That&#8217;s where we&#8217;re headed.</p>
<p>Despite the drive, I am keen to do this. Wharfedale&#8217;s founder, G.A. Briggs, was a schoolboy hero of mine. I still have his book Loudspeakers: The Why and How of Good Reproduction. In it, he shows plans for a loudspeaker enclosure made of 48 bricks. My friend, Robert Parker, actually built one in his mother&#8217;s living room. No stereo in those days, so it was just the one large, brick enclosure, right on the carpet.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong> When the going gets tough&#8230; <span style="color:#444444;font-weight:normal;">Nine o&#8217;clock, we made it. Stagger in to the Wharfedale reception.</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re here to film the factory, can I see Bob Brown?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Brown is tied up at the moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>We need coffee. &#8220;Sorry, no coffee.&#8221; Tea? &#8220;No tea. Sit down.&#8221;</p>
<p>Time passes. More time passes. We got up at 4:30 for this! Eventually, &#8220;Mr. Brown says it&#8217;s not convenient for you to film today. I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is not acceptable. Your head office booked us for today and today it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Brown is adamant-no filming today. Please leave.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>&#8230;The tough keep shooting.</strong> We go out to the car. Get out the Éclair 16mm camera. Tricia has the Nagra tape recorder and a Sennheiser rifle mike. We find the door into the factory and wander around, shooting from the shoulder. Meet friendly people doing their job.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you met Old Bill? He&#8217;s been here since Gilbert Briggs.&#8221;</p>
<p>They take us to meet Old Bill. He&#8217;s the man in charge of the wood veneers; been doing it for 23 years. Tricia runs the Nagra and I ask him to tell us about how the veneers are done.</p>
<p>Just then, with the camera still running, I hear what must be Bob Brown on the warpath. We keep shooting Old Bill. This is going to be very bad timing for ugly Bob.</p>
<p>&#8220;What the **** are you doing! I said no filming!&#8221;</p>
<p>I swing the Éclair around, still running. He stops dead in his tracks. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad you found Old Bill. He&#8217;s been here over 20 years. You&#8217;re doing a great job. Seem to have it all under control.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong> Reversal of fortune.</strong> I switch off the camera. Suddenly he&#8217;s Mr. Nice Guy:</p>
<p>&#8220;I like you two. You&#8217;ve got the right attitude. Not like those stupid wimps in head office. You&#8217;re not Rank people, are you? Can I buy you lunch?&#8221;</p>
<p>We all go off to a cozy little restaurant. Get to know each other. I tell him my Radar the Wonder Dog story (DV, June 2007). We come back to shoot their anechoic chamber and new range of speakers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Joyce, they&#8217;re OK-not from Rank!&#8221; Now even his secretary likes us. &#8220;Would you like a cup of tea?&#8221;</p>
<p>We finish the job. Pack up, not looking forward to the long drive back. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you stay the night? There&#8217;s a good hotel nearby. Dinner is on me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Over a glass of wine, I tell him about my G.A. Briggs book and Robert&#8217;s brick loudspeaker enclosure. &#8220;Well you must film Gilbert Briggs. He lives in the Yorkshire Dales.&#8221;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The next morning we drive north to visit Gilbert, who is delighted to tell his story on camera. Gilbert looks directly at the lens and says, &#8220;The worst mistake in my life was selling my company to The Rank Organisation.&#8221;</p>
<p>His interview was never shown at the conference. Funny about that.</p>

<p><strong>101 South from Corte Madera, Calif. March, 2002</strong>. George, my son-in-law, is driving his ginormous Ford E-350 Super Duty Extended wagon. It&#8217;s crammed full of cameras, tripods, lights, lights stands, sand bags, you name it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m chattering on, &#8220;I don&#8217;t have a list, I just do a complete set up in my living room the night before. Check the lights, run the cameras. Then I pack it all up in one suitcase and a camera bag.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well that&#8217;s fine for you, but I&#8217;d rather work from a fully equipped truck. If I need a couple of HMIs, they are packed and ready. I leave everything in the truck. I never have to worry about leaving anything behind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you have to take out the batteries to re-charge?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the only thing I take out—I take out—the—the batteries—sheeeeet!!!&#8221;</p>
<p>We are passing Daly City—about halfway. George stops, gets out and checks the van. Nope—no batteries nowhere.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s on the cell to the office. &#8220;Steven, quick, grab the Betacam batteries, they&#8217;re on charge. Get the address from the call sheet. Meet you in San Jose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stay calm,&#8221; says George to me. I&#8217;m calm; it&#8217;s not my screw up. &#8220;We drive there. Arrive on time. Then I&#8217;ll do the best, slowest, setting up job you&#8217;ve ever seen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Downtown San Jose. George meets Heidi, his client. The space is a big conference room with windows on every side.</p>
<p>We unload the van. I secretly phone Steven from time to time.</p>
<p>Now he&#8217;s crossing the GG Bridge. George: &#8220;Can we move the conference table a little? Take the chairs out?&#8221;</p>
<p>Batteries at Daly City. &#8220;Maybe we should blackout the windows.&#8221; I get the ND 0.6 gel and a roll of gaffer tape.</p>
<p>Batteries now passing SFO airport. &#8220;We really need a better background. Can I use that company board in your reception?&#8221;</p>
<p>Batteries at Redwood City. &#8220;I just think we need to take down the background a little. Stefan, can you get some gobos from the truck and another C stand?&#8221;</p>
<p>Batteries at Mountain View. &#8220;You know, I&#8217;d like to add a bit of powder to your forehead. There&#8217;s a little shine there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Heidi: &#8220;George, you are the best cameraman I&#8217;ve ever met. So much attention to detail.&#8221; George: &#8220;I&#8217;m really a producer—and you are my product.&#8221;</p>
<p>Batteries now entering San Jose. &#8220;I think we are ready to rock.&#8221; Steven enters the room. Slips George a battery like a palming a $100 bill to a Las Vegas maître d&#8217;. The camera bursts into life.</p>
<p>&#8220;Heidi, You look terrific. I&#8217;m running.&#8221;</p>
<p>George collects $200 and passes GO.</p>
<p><strong>A Right Royal Screw Up</strong></p>

Those ears. Oh my!</p></div>
<p><strong> Windsor Castle, U.K. November, 1975. </strong>We&#8217;ve been here for three hours to shoot a three-camera interview with Prince Charles and Alistair Cooke. Titled &#8220;A Much Maligned Monarch,&#8221; it&#8217;s been presold across the States in time for the 1776 bicentennial.</p>
<p>Tricia sits in for both Charles and Alistair while I adjust the lights. Wow, that looks great! Colin Clarke, the producer, looks through the viewfinder at Tricia. &#8220;Perfect!&#8221;</p>
<p>So where&#8217;s the prince? We turn off the lights and wander around aimlessly down the nearby art-filled corridor. Rembrandt, Rubens, Holbein&#8230;We don&#8217;t go far as the palace staff are there all the time&#8230;watching.</p>
<p>Three more hours pass. Finally, the royal party arrives.</p>
<p>Tricia wires up the 27-year-old prince with a lavaliere mike. She&#8217;s wearing a form-fitting jump suit with a zipper top to bottom. The prince is intrigued in the mechanics of the zipper. I switch on the lights.</p>
<p>SURPRISE. Charles&#8217; ears light up like pink stained glass—the backlight is shining right through them. Those ears. Oh my! What was terrific lighting for Tricia is a total disaster for Prince Charles.</p>
<p>&#8220;OK, Let&#8217;s go&#8221;, says a tense Colin.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I need to make some lighting adjustments.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, Stefan. It looked great when I looked through the viewfinder.&#8221; How can I say, &#8220;The Prince&#8217;s glowing ears don&#8217;t meet broadcast spec&#8221;?</p>
<p>I fiddle with the backlight. &#8220;I need some spun glass and a chopper.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stefan, you&#8217;ve had all day to set up! It&#8217;s fine—leave it.&#8221;</p>
<p>I need 15 minutes to fix. I can feel tension mounting. &#8220;STEFAN, WE ARE WAITING.&#8221; OK, I give in. &#8220;Roll cameras—slate it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Much Maligned Monarch, take one.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stefan does not collect $200. The prince has bright red ears—he hasn&#8217;t spoken to me since!</p>

				<p><em>Way back in 1958, Bert Stern had a multicam shoot at the Newport Jazz Festival. Jazz on a Summer’s Day took just a few days to shoot, but six months to sync up the cameras and the sound. It was “a very painful and difficult process,” Stern once said. </em></p>
<p><em>He never made another movie. If only he’d had today’s technology.</em></p>
<p><strong>Nob Hill Masonic Center, San Francisco, July, 2007.</strong> Here on another Summer’s Day, I have a multicam shoot. Louis Armstrong couldn’t make it, but no matter. We have Dr. Graham Powell, Professor Emeritus of Civil Engineering, UC Berkeley. The lecture is about “nonlinear modeling and analysis for performance-based design.” Huh? Where’s Louis?</p>
<p>I set up two Sony V1U cameras, side by side, halfway up the center aisle. On one I’ve switched on the internal X1.5 digital telephoto—that’s my close-up camera. The other I’ll use for the wide shot. I operate both cameras, but the wide is really locked-off until question time.</p>
<div id="attachment_63" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://prior.stefansargent.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/sargent1007.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-63" class="size-full wp-image-63" title="sargent1007" src="https://prior.stefansargent.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/sargent1007.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="360" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/sargent1007.jpg 1210w, /wp-content/uploads/2010/05/sargent1007-300x169.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2010/05/sargent1007-768x433.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2010/05/sargent1007-1024x577.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"/></a><p id="caption-attachment-63" class="wp-caption-text">Some Hysteresis Loop Shapes,” courtesy of Dr. Powell’s PowerPoint and Camera 2.</p></div>
<p>The venue has supplied an IATSE cameraman, Dimitri. He’s good. I put him on the stage with a third V1U. Tricia gaffer tapes his tripod to a spreader with wheels. I tell Dimitri he’s free to get the best shots—audience shots, close-ups, wide shots, reverse angles of the presenter—by repositioning the camera during the show. We switch off his red light so that it doesn’t distract the audience.</p>
<p>I’ve reset the timecode on all three cameras to “FREE RUN.” Now, here’s how to sync up the cameras in a jiffy. Get a Sony RMT-841 remote control. Power up the three cameras, hit “TC RESET,” and bingo—all three timecodes go to 00:00:00:00. The cameras will stay locked even when you change tapes. Magic. Eat your heart out, Bert.</p>
<p>The sound is coming from the PA mixer. Now for a secret weapon: a Shure A15AS XLR audio pad. If you’re getting a feed from a PA system, a pad is essential. They may say they are sending you line level, and then blast you clean away. Just as well that I brought a XLR gender changer. The feed was XLR female—how is that possible?</p>
<p>At every hour, Dimitri and I change tapes. I have a cute Sony DR60 disc unit on my close-up camera. I only want to use it when I’m changing tapes, so I run it manually before the change and stop recording once the new tape is running.</p>
<div id="attachment_69" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://prior.stefansargent.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/sargent1007_22.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-69" class="size-full wp-image-69" title="sargent1007_2" src="https://prior.stefansargent.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/sargent1007_22.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="360" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/sargent1007_22.jpg 1210w, /wp-content/uploads/2010/05/sargent1007_22-300x169.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2010/05/sargent1007_22-768x433.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2010/05/sargent1007_22-1024x577.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"/></a><p id="caption-attachment-69" class="wp-caption-text">Camera 1&#039;s close-up.</p></div>
<p>Dimitri’s on-stage camera has rolled into a position where he can get a good shot of the presenter when he turns away from the audience and looks up to the PowerPoint slide on the screen. My two cameras only see the back of his head, so that third, on-stage camera is essential. Come question time, Dimitri has good shots of the audience.</p>
<p>When it’s all over, I whip out my Memory Stick and grab a copy of the PowerPoint file from Dr. Powell’s laptop. No real secret. The trick is: always carry a Memory Stick. Back at base, today’s shoot has produced 22 one-hour DV tapes and one tape copied from the DR60 disc drive. Good labeling is essential. I wouldn’t be without my Brother PT 1830 labeler.</p>
<p>Although we shot HDV 1080i, I do this edit in standard def. I use a Sony M25 desk player, feeding its HDMI output into a nanoConnect box from Convergent Design, and the SDI output into my G5 via an internal BlackMagic DeckLink HD card. I also have an external BlackMagic HDLink, but that’s only for monitoring.</p>
<div id="attachment_65" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://prior.stefansargent.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/sargent1007_3.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-65" class="size-full wp-image-65" title="sargent1007_3" src="https://prior.stefansargent.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/sargent1007_3.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="360" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/sargent1007_3.jpg 1210w, /wp-content/uploads/2010/05/sargent1007_3-300x169.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2010/05/sargent1007_3-768x433.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2010/05/sargent1007_3-1024x577.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"/></a><p id="caption-attachment-65" class="wp-caption-text">The view from Camera 3 on stage.</p></div>
<p>Now all I have to do is edit six hours of a totally incomprehensible technical seminar. I do this in real time using Final Cut Pro’s multicam and a glass of cabernet. With the multicam edit complete, I switch to merlot and cut in over 350 PowerPoint slides. It’s tough checking an edit that runs for over six hours, so I ask my client to help. Hey, just one wrong slide and a three-second black hole. Easy to fix. Time to make the DVD menus and burn two dual-layer DVDs. Six hours on two DVDs. Amazing.</p>
<p>As a thank you for the celebratory champagne, I make a no-charge 60 sec. promo. See it at <a href="http://www.csiberkeley.com/Powell/DVD/" target="_blank">http://www.csiberkeley.com/Powell/DVD/</a>.</p>
<p>And rent or buy Jazz on a Summer’s Day. Sorry, no V1s, no DR60, no nanoConnect, no BlackMagic, no FCP. Just Louis, Anita, Chuck, etc.—and all in 84 minutes!</p>

				<p><strong>FIRST BLOOD. <span style="font-weight:normal;"><strong>Sydney, Australia, 1968.</strong> “Here’s the deal Stefan. I’ve got this weekly report from the markets which you’ll shoot and edit. It should be $750 a week but I can make it a grand. Send me a credit note for the last job. I’ll make sure you get the market reports.”</span></strong></p>
<p>I give him credit. Surprise! The market job is delayed a month. Another month. Six months pass. The weekly market reports never happen. Do I get paid for the original job? Of course not.</p>

<p><strong> AMBUSH.  <span style="font-weight:normal;"><strong>London, 1982. </strong>I’m running Molinare, the biggest video facility in Soho. Alan Stewart, our wonderful builder, needs to be paid. Unlike 30-day trade accounts, builders want their money fast. Alan’s accounts are simple. He pays for his building materials cash on pick up. He pays his workers cash each Friday. I pay him every week. What’s left over is profit. Who needs accountants?</span></strong></p>
<p>But our cash flow is low. We’ve been chasing our debtors like crazy, but it’s not coming in fast enough.</p>
<p>I show Alan our accounts receivable.</p>
<p>“I’ll sort out your bad payers,” he says. “Pay me as I bring it in.”</p>
<p>“Let me see—look, this guy Adrian R. is on Wardour St. He owes us £12,500, most of it over 90 days. Go get him.”</p>
<p>Alan and five builders, all carrying tools of trade, head for Adrian R. on Wardour St., about five minutes’ walk away.</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes later Alan returns, £12,500 check in hand.</p>
<p>“Alan, what did you do?”</p>
<p>“Nothing—I just said that I couldn’t pay my men because he hadn’t paid Molinare’s bills</p>
<p>. My lads were wandering around the office straightening the paintings. He pulled out his checkbook there and then.”<br/>
A few weeks later, Adrian R. is in my office. He’s promising prompt payment in future and hoping he’s welcome back as a client.</p>
<p><strong>BATTLEFIELD HOLLYWOOD. <span style="color:#444444;font-weight:normal;"><strong>London, 1992.</strong> I am making a 90-minute “sell-through” video, The Trials of Claus von Bülow, for a major Hollywood company. I finish the job. Everyone happy. I invoice for $50,000.</span></strong></p>
<p>But no. “You’ll have to bill our New York office.” I send them the invoice and wait. After a month, I phone. “Where’s the E&amp;O certificate?” they say. I get one. It costs $16,000 even after getting a signed release from von Bülow himself.</p>
<p>I chase again. “We are waiting for the laboratory negative release form.” I explain that there is no laboratory, no film negative. It’s a VIDEO.</p>
<p>“The contract specifically states we must have a laboratory negative release.”</p>
<p>“But there is no negative!”</p>
<p>“That doesn’t matter—are you going to sign the form or not?”</p>
<p>I FedEx a laboratory release form. But then, they relocate from NYC to L.A. Can’t find their files.</p>
<p>Next, “We can’t pay you unless the film has U.S. copyright with the Library of Congress.”</p>
<p>Seven months after master tape handover, we get their rotten $50,000.</p>
<p><strong>ATTACK OF THE CLONES. <span style="font-weight:normal;"><strong>San Francisco, June, 2007. </strong>I’m chasing a job that I shot last year and edited over Christmas. That’s six months ago. The final payment hasn’t happened.</span></strong></p>
<p>“No worries, Stefan. We’re working on it.”</p>
<p>Working on it? Huh? It’s a piece of paper: the date, my name, the amount, a signature.</p>
<p>“But I’m glad you called. I’ve got a TV commercial I want you to do.”</p>
<p>Here we go again: the old “Big Job Coming Real Soon” routine.</p>
<p>Time to send in the builders.</p>

				<p><strong>London, Soho, February, 1999.</strong> 8:00 p.m. Boooom! I’m in my edit room-cum-office at the rear of The Soho Screening Rooms. Derry, the projectionist, is showing the director’s cut of Das Boot. Every time the U-boat is depth-charged, my adjoining wall shakes so much that tapes fall off the shelves. I’m bracing myself for another charge. Boooom! Trying to edit a conference video that’s needed for tomorrow in Holland. Boooom! Got to meet my client, Martin—ICI’s group public affairs VP—at the airport.</p>
<div id="attachment_52" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://prior.stefansargent.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/sargent0807.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-52" class="size-full wp-image-52" title="sargent0807" src="https://prior.stefansargent.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/sargent0807.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="593" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/sargent0807.jpg 847w, /wp-content/uploads/2010/05/sargent0807-300x278.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2010/05/sargent0807-768x712.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"/></a><p id="caption-attachment-52" class="wp-caption-text">Tomorrow’s conference has three circular screens—just more work for me. This one depicts Wells Fargo’s exploding bank notes.</p></div>
<p>My BetaSP machine died yesterday. Chewed up tape. I rented a replacement today, but before I could lay off a safety copy to tape, my client wanted mega changes.</p>
<p>The Avid is unhappy too. It doesn’t like it when I go to the loo (translation: restroom). It misses me and crashes. I really have to go to the loo again but can’t risk it. I decide to go out into the reception area and then return. Fooled it. Still running.</p>
<p>This time I’ll take those few extra steps to the loo. I come back. It’s dead again. Thinking of making a life size replica of me so that the Avid thinks I’m still here.</p>
<p>Reminds me of the story about the lady with the broken vacuum-tube radio. She discovered that if she put her finger on a tube, the sound would come back. Tired of keeping her finger there, she replaced it with a pork sausage. It worked! The problem was that the sausage cooked slowly and needed to be replaced every Friday. “Hey mum, the radio’s fading, needs another sausage!”</p>
<p><strong>10:00 p.m.</strong> I’m assembling the segments and keying in a circle matte. The team doing the set design and projection has succeeded in convincing the ICI conference lady to have three circular screens, one big and two small on either side. They call it “MoonVision.” Spare me from “creatives.” My compilation video is 85 minutes and all within a stupid circle.</p>
<p><strong>Midnight</strong>. This is crazy. Das Boot is over. Derry has closed down the projection theatre. I’m alone. I’ve gotta go to de loo. I need to fool the Avid:</p>
<p>“Look, I’m just going to the Poland Street garage to collect my car. You be a good Avid and keep rendering those dumb circle mattes. Back very soon. Love you.”</p>
<p>Never fooled Avid for a moment. Whammy, it crashes again. Not your average Panic Kernel. It’s a (gasp!) General Error 41. The Mac’s running but Avid’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>3:00 a.m.</strong> Nothing is working. I’ve done everything. Trashed preferences, ran Fix Permissions. Tried Disk Utilities, Norton, Disk Warrior, you name it. This job is on my books at £35,000 (US $70,000) and it has to be ready for today. Got to be out of here by 5:00 a.m. I’m distraught.</p>
<p>A thought. I have a BlueICE board in the Avid. It runs hot. I’ve squeezed in three little fans around the board and there’s a household fan on the floor pumping air into the Mac. The card gets so hot that its own heat sinks fall off. The Avid’s never been the same. Maybe it’s just a heat problem. OK, take it easy and cool it.</p>
<p>I turn everything off except the external fan. Vacate to the empty reception area. Nibble at the Das Boot leftovers in the kitchen. This is going to be my big, big screw up.</p>
<p>“Sorry Martin, Avid’s crashed. General Error 41.”</p>
<p>“The fertilizer plant in Taiwan?”</p>
<p>“Trashed.”</p>
<p>“Surfactants in Delaware?”</p>
<p>“Dead.”</p>
<p>“Australian ethane pipeline?</p>
<p>“Nope.”</p>
<p>“Wells Fargo exploding bank notes?”</p>
<p>“All gone. It’s over. I’m off. Got a green card. You’ll never find me.”</p>
<p>I go back. One last try. Give my Mac the old Das Boot start up. This is it baby, make or break. Yeah! Error 41 gone. Woo hoo! Avid opens up my project. I’m delirious. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>Render, render. Now save the project. Transfer 85 minutes to BetaSP tape—no time for a safety copy.</p>
<p><strong>5:00 a.m.</strong> I spot check the tape. High on Das Boot caffeine. Drive home. Shower. Shave. Pack overnight things. Suit ‘n’ tie. Drive to Heathrow. Park. Run to Terminal One.</p>
<p><strong>8:00 a.m.</strong> Made it. There’s Martin.</p>
<p>“Hi Martin!”</p>
<p>“Everything OK?”</p>
<p>“Piece of cake.”</p>
